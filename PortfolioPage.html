          <h2>Clean Freaks</h2>
          <p>Clean up the world with Scrubby, Sweeps, Mopper, Polished, and Wipet! Everything you clean brings you closer to tidiness! Grab your friends and have them RAG along in this fun, multiplayer experience! Your abilities will SWEEP the nation, and the world will be watching! Scrub, wash, and wipe as fast as you can, because there’s no BROOM for failure! Did I mention you also get funny hats? Use the bucket to wet the dirty floors, and the mop to clean up. Use a spray bottle and a bar of soap to clean off dirty furniture. Over these 4 levels, you'll make sure everything is nice and clean, regardless of what you destroy in the process! This game supports up to 4 players locally using controllers. We primarily support Xbox controllers, but Switch or PlayStation controllers will work too. Mouse and keyboard also work. It was made during a 3-day global game jam.</p>
